        “Ranking the Resume”, an automated process, will help the company by reducing their headache of dealing with large number of resumes
        in short span of time. User will upload the bulk of resumes and system will scrutinize each resume one by one and rank them as per
        company’s resume ranking policy. A more detailed description of workflow is given below. Initially, using front-end technology like HTML5,
        CSS3 and Bootstrap we will build a web application, wherein company, as a user, will create their account to access this facility. Python
        based web application will be build using Flask framework and SQLite database. User can upload any number of resumes, which will be
        garner by the system for the further process. After this, system will start scanning the main keywords and their corresponding value. Those
        values are then stored in the database with specified keyword. Similar process will take place for each resume. After each resume is stored in
        the database, they are rank as per company’s resume ranking policy.
